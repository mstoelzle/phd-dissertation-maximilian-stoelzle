\chapter{Modeling of Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA) Robots}
\label{chp:hsamodel}

\begin{foreword}
    Novel soft robots based on \glspl{HSA} show great promise by integrating multiple \gls{DOF} in a compact form. Their parallel nature promises a larger payload capacity while preserving compliance. Notably, they represent a paradigm shift in the soft robotics domain by i) establishing compliance through their metamaterial structure rather than material softness and ii) transmitting actuation through their elasticity with the auxetic metamaterial instead of directly applying forces and torques into the desired directions of deformation.
    However, despite the extensive literature on their design, fabrication, and integration of sensing, the absence of kinematic and dynamic models hinders their widespread adoption. These models are crucial for developing accurate simulators and effective model-based controllers.
    This chapter addresses this gap by demonstrating how kinematic and dynamical models can be derived for general 3D motion scenarios. Furthermore, we present low-dimensional kinematical parametrizations and a control-oriented Euler-Lagrangian model tailored explicitly to planar \gls{HSA} robot motions.
    We follow here a strategy of exploiting the vast and well-grounded literature on control-oriented modeling of rigid robotic manipulators and augment them with a specialized kinematic model based on the \gls{PCS} parametrization and a nonlinear, actuation-dependent elastic model.

\begin{abstract}
    Electrically-actuated continuum soft robots based on \glspl{HSA} promise rapid actuation capabilities while preserving structural compliance. However, the foundational models of these novel actuators required for precise control strategies are missing. This chapter proposes two key components extending the \gls{DCM} to allow for modeling \glspl{HSA}. First, we propose a mechanism for incorporating the auxetic trajectory into \gls{DCM} dynamical simulations. We also propose an implementation of this extension as a plugin for the Elastica simulator. Second, we introduce a \gls{SPCS} kinematic parameterization that can describe an HSA segment's shape with fewer configuration variables. We verify both theoretical contributions experimentally. The simulator is used to replicate experimental data of the mechanical characterization of HSA rods. For the second component, we attach motion capture markers at various points to a parallel HSA robot and find that the shape of the HSAs can be kinematically represented with an average accuracy of \SI{0.3}{mm} for positions and \SI{0.07}{rad} for orientations.
