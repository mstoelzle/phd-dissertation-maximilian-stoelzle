\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we proposed to combine motor imagery-based \gls{BMI} systems with continuum soft robots. This symbiosis promises the safe and compliant operation of robots that can assist people with limb impairments in their daily lives.
As demonstrated in the \gls{ADL} experiment, the physical intelligence of the soft robot can compensate for errors and deviations in the output of the \gls{BMI} classifier.
Furthermore, we introduced a Cartesian impedance controller for planar \gls{HSA} robots that can deal with the peculiar characteristics of these robots (e.g., underactuation, non-affinity in control, etc.), and allows for model-based control without interfering with the structural compliance of the system.
