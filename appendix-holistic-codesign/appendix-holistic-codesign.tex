\begin{abstract}
    % Soft robots promise inherent safety and embodied intelligence, enabling seamless interactions with both people and delicate environments. Yet their development remains challenging, as it requires integrating materials, geometry, actuation, and control into a cohesive design strategy. Despite recent progress, the field still struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader system-level considerations, often resulting in fragmented design approaches. For instance, lacking a quantitative safety metric, many designs are rendered overly soft—compromising crucial performance aspects such as motion precision and payload capacity. In this chapter, we propose a holistic co-design framework that transcends conventional optimization by viewing soft robots as inherently interconnected systems. Specifically, we call for the creation of a quantitative safety metric for soft robots, introduce techniques to significantly enhance computational efficiency in co-design, and advocate for moving beyond solely simulation-based evaluations by incorporating purposeful real-world prototyping. We believe that this holistic framework has the potential to greatly enhance the performance and overall value of soft robots while maintaining essential safety, ultimately redefining human-robot interaction and fostering greater acceptance and confidence in soft robotic systems.  
    % The development of soft robots remains particularly challenging, as it requires integrating materials, geometry, actuation, and autonomy stacks into a complex mechatronic system. Despite recent progress, the field still struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader system-level considerations, such as durability and manufacturability, often resulting in not sufficiently effective designs, that is at least partially a consequence of a traditional sequential design process.
    % Recently, co-design approaches that co-optimize the body and brain of soft robots have been started to be investigated.
    % However, while designing morphology and control together has lead to the identification of interesting unconventional designs, the existing methods have three major shortcomings: First, most approaches evaluate one task performance metric sin simulation, while a design that is effective and optimal in the real world needs to fulfill many more values.
    % Secondly, existing approaches focus on computational modeling of the design and ignore that the goal at the end is to realize the design into a mechatronic system whose actual performance might be degraded as a result of the sim-to-real gap.
    % Thirdly, existing approaches are computationally inefficient, therefore, not allowing an effective exploration of the full design space.
    % In this chapter, we propose a holistic co-design framework for soft robots that aims to resolve all three challenges by i) considering a broad of design values, ii) explicitly account for the realization of the design and how prototyping in the real world can help decrease the uncertainty in metrics that we use to optimize the design, iii) multiple modifications that have the potential to dramatically increase the computational efficiency, such as auxiliary metrics that are less expensive to evaluate or a model-based derivation of the control policy.

    The development of soft robots remains particularly challenging, as it requires integrating materials, geometry, actuation, and autonomy stacks into a complex mechatronic system. Despite recent progress, the field still struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader system-level considerations—such as durability and manufacturability—often resulting in suboptimal designs, partly due to following a traditional sequential design process. Recently, co-design approaches that simultaneously optimize the body and brain of soft robots have begun to emerge. While combining morphology and control has revealed intriguing, unconventional designs, existing methods face three major shortcomings. First, most approaches rely on simulation-based evaluations that focus on a single performance metric, even though an effective real-world design must satisfy a broader range of values. Second, current methods concentrate on computational modeling without fully addressing the need to realize the design as a mechatronic system whose performance can be compromised by the sim-to-real gap. Third, these approaches are computationally inefficient, limiting the exploration of the full design space.
    In this chapter, we propose a holistic co-design framework for soft robots that tackles these challenges by (i) considering a wider array of design values, (ii) explicitly accounting for the realization of the design and how real-world prototyping can reduce uncertainties in evaluation metrics, and (iii) incorporating modifications that dramatically increase computational efficiency—such as using less expensive auxiliary metrics or adopting model-based control derivation. We believe this holistic framework has the potential to significantly enhance the performance and overall value of soft robots, ultimately redefining human-robot interaction and fostering greater acceptance and confidence in these systems.
