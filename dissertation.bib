  abstract  = {This is the first chapter to explicitly address fluid media. For springs and solids, Hooke's law, or its generalization using stress, strain, and elastic moduli provided an equation of state. In fluids, we have an equation of state that relates changes in pressure (stresses) to changes in density (strain). The simplest fluidic equations of state are the Ideal Gas Laws. Our presentation of these laws will combine microscopic models that treat gas atoms as hard spheres with phenomenological (thermodynamic) models that combine the variables that describe the gas with conservation laws that restrict those variables. The combination of microscopic and phenomenological models will give us the important characteristics of gas behavior under isothermal or adiabatic conditions and will provide relationships between gas heat capacities and their constituent particles when augmented with elementary concepts from quantum mechanics. The chapter ends by adding a velocity field to the pressure, temperature, and density, thus providing the equations of hydrodynamics that will guide all of the subsequent development of acoustics in fluids.},

  abstract        = {This work presents an autonomous soft-bodied robotic fish that is hydraulically actuated and capable of sustained swimming in three dimensions. The design of a fish-like soft body has been extended to deform under hydraulic instead of pneumatic power. Moreover, a new closed-circuit drive system that uses water as a transmission fluid is used to actuate the soft body. Circulation of water through internal body channels provides control over the fish's caudal fin propulsion and yaw motion. A new fabrication technique for the soft body is described, which allows for arbitrary internal fluidic channels, enabling a wide-range of continuous body deformations. Furthermore, dynamic diving capabilities are introduced through pectoral fins as dive planes. These innovations enable prolonged fish-like locomotion in three dimensions.},

The end effector of the soft manipulator is fabricated in one piece without weakening seams using lost-wax casting instead of the commonly used multi-layer lamination process. The soft manipulation system can grasp randomly positioned objects within its reachable envelope and move them to a desired location without human intervention. The autonomous planning system leverages the compliance and continuum bending of the soft grasping manipulator to achieve repeatable grasps in the presence of uncertainty. A suite of experiments is presented that demonstrates the system's capabilities.},

@article{marchese2014whole,
  abstract = {Soft continuum manipulators have the advantage of being more compliant and having more degrees of freedom than rigid redundant manipulators. This attribute should allow soft manipulators to autonomously execute highly dexterous tasks. However, current approaches to motion planning, inverse kinematics, and even design limit the capacity of soft manipulators to take full advantage of their inherent compliance. We provide a computational approach to whole arm planning for a soft planar manipulator that advances the arm's end effector pose in task space while simultaneously considering the arm's entire envelope in proximity to a confined environment. The algorithm solves a series of constrained optimization problems to determine locally optimal inverse kinematics. Due to inherent limitations in modeling the kinematics of a highly compliant soft robot and the local optimality of the planner's solutions, we also rely on the increased softness of our newly designed manipulator to accomplish the whole arm task, namely the arm's ability to harmlessly collide with the environment. We detail the design and fabrication of the new modular manipulator as well as the planner's central algorithm. We experimentally validate our approach by showing that the robotic system is capable of autonomously advancing the soft arm through a pipe-like environment in order to reach distinct goal states.},

  abstract = {Robotics researchers increasingly agree that ideas from biology and self-organization can strongly benefit the design of autonomous robots. Biological organisms have evolved to perform and survive in a world characterized by rapid changes, high uncertainty, indefinite richness, and limited availability of information. Industrial robots, in contrast, operate in highly controlled environments with no or very little uncertainty. Although many challenges remain, concepts from biologically inspired (bio-inspired) robotics will eventually enable researchers to engineer machines for the real world that possess at least some of the desirable properties of biological organisms, such as adaptivity, robustness, versatility, and agility.}

  abstract  = {Contact constraints, such as those between a foot and the ground or a hand and an object, are inherent in many robotic tasks. These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm (DIRCON) that extends the direct collocation method, naturally incorporating manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy-a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the manifold tangent plane. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation.},

  abstract = { A new adaptive robot control algorithm is derived, which consists of a PD feedback part and a full dynamics feedforward compensation part, with the unknown manipulator and payload parameters being estimated online. The algorithm is computationally simple, because of an effective exploitation of the structure of manipulator dynamics. In particular, it requires neither feedback of joint accelerations nor inversion of the estimated inertia matrix. The algorithm can also be applied directly in Cartesian space. }

  abstract  = {Parallel robots based on Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSAs) can implement complex motions using standard electric motors while maintaining the complete softness of the structure, thanks to specifically designed architected metamaterials. However, their control is especially challenging due to varying and coupled stiffness, shearing, non-affine terms in the actuation model, and underactuation. In this paper, we present a model-based control strategy for planar HSA robots enabling regulation in task space. We formulate equations of motion, show that they admit a collocated form, and design a P-satI-D feedback controller with compensation for elastic and gravitational forces. We experimentally identify and verify the proposed control strategy in closed loop.},
