\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}

\textit{
% This chapters positions the dissertation within the societal context and specifically the challenges that we are facing when bringing robotics into human-centered environments and for robots to assist us with activities of daily living.
% Firstly, we explain how soft robots with their intrinsic safety can contribute to addressing this challenge, although they currently face performance limitations, in particular with respect to their precision.
% Subsequently, we motivate how emplyoing modern machine learning methods with their significant expressiveness could enable learning much more accurate dynamic models of the complex behavior that soft robots exhibit. In order to preserve insight into the decision making, stability guarantees, and the computational efficiency of the controller, we aim to integrate physical structure into learned models such that we can leverage them within closed-form model-based controllers.
% Next, we present the research questions that this thesis aims to tackle including the contributions that this thesis makes to contribute to address those research questions.
% Finally, we outline the structure of this thesis and connect chapters to relevant topics, the contributions, and the strength of physical priors within the used models.
This chapter situates the dissertation within the broader societal context, addressing the challenges of integrating robotics into human-centered environments and assisting with daily living activities. First, we explain how soft robots, with their inherent safety, can help overcome these challenges despite current performance limitationsâ€”particularly regarding precision. Next, we argue that employing modern machine learning methods, with their significant expressiveness, could enable the development of far more accurate dynamic models of the complex behaviors exhibited by soft robots. To maintain transparency in decision-making, ensure stability guarantees, and preserve computational efficiency in the controller, our approach integrates physical structure into the learned models for use in closed-form model-based controllers. We then present the research questions this thesis aims to tackle, along with the corresponding contributions. Finally, we outline the structure of the thesis, connecting each chapter to the relevant topics, contributions, and the strength of physical priors within the employed models.
