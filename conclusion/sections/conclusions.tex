\subsection{Contribution I - Safety Metric}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} We propose a quantitative safety metric that is tailored to soft robots and that can be computed in a computationally tractable fashion.
%     \item \textbf{Limitations:} Missing experimental verification, constrained to slender structures, assumes linear contact, conservative as it relies on an approximation of the kinematic model behavior
% \end{itemize}
% In Chapter~\ref{chp:safetymetric}, we derived a quantitative safety metric for soft robots that accounts for the peculiar characteristics and dynamics of soft robots by deriving the collision dynamics between the soft robot and a human from first principles.
% Specifically, we take analog to the ISO design standard for \glspl{Cobot}~\citep{Isots_15066_2016}, the maximum contact pressure experienced during the collision as a proxy for the possible injury severity.
% To reduce the computational burden for evaluating this metric, we identify a conservative upper bound on the injury severity that allows us to state the maximum contact pressure in closed form.
% Crucially, the proposed \glsextrafull{ISC} allows for collisions along the entire continuum soft robot body and is built based on existing and verified soft robotic dynamic models which take into account the inertia, elasticity, and actuation of the soft robot.
% We extend this metric to assess the safety of a soft robotic design by evaluating the maximum \gls{ISC} within the operating conditions of the soft robots.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:safetymetric}, we introduced a quantitative safety metric for soft robots by modeling the collision dynamics between a soft robot and a human from first principles. Following the ISO standards for cobots~\citep{Isots_15066_2016}, we use the maximum contact pressure during a collision as a proxy for injury severity. To keep the evaluation computationally efficient, we derived a conservative upper bound that allows for a closed-form expression of the maximum contact pressure. Notably, the proposed \gls{ISC} accommodates collisions along the entire continuum of the soft robot and is built on validated dynamic models that incorporate its inertia, elasticity, and actuation. We then apply this metric to assess a soft robotic design by evaluating the maximum \gls{ISC} under its operating conditions.

% We concede that the proposed safety metric has not yet been experimentally verified and validated. 
% % Furthermore, as a consequence of the underlying dynamic model, it only
% Additionally, we take several assumptions (e.g., no dissipation, a linear spring contact force model, the human as a constrained point mass, and a finite number of backbone segments) to make the evaluation of the metric more computationally tractable, leading to a conservative estimate of the injury severity.
% This underestimation of the safety could possibly lead to less performant and too cautious robot behavior.
% Future work might explore how the safety could be computed more accurately while preserving a computationally tractable setting.
We acknowledge that our safety metric has not yet been experimentally validated. To ensure computational tractability, we made several simplifying assumptions—such as neglecting dissipation, using a linear spring contact model, modeling the human as a constrained point mass, and limiting the number of backbone segments—which result in a conservative injury severity estimate. This conservative bias might lead, for example when leveraging the metric for safety-aware control, to overly cautious robot behavior. Future work should focus on refining the metric to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

In Section~\ref{sec:conclusion:future_work}, we give recommendations for future research and interesting applications for the proposed safety metric.

\subsection{Contribution II - Leveraging Kinematic Models for Soft Robot Shape Sensing}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} We can leverage kinematic models for shape sensing by solving optimization problems that aim to find an agreement between sensor measurements and the attainable backbone shapes allowed by the kinematic model.
%     \item \textbf{Limitations:} No real-world experiment with multi-segment soft robots and more complex kinematic models. Many sensing methodologies that we did not investigate. Knowledge about the dynamics should be made more use of, and observers should be embraced.
% \end{itemize}
% We have shown in Chapters~\ref{chp:srslam} \& \ref{chp:promasens} how kinematic models (e.g. \gls{PCC}~\citep{webster2010design}) can be leveraged within shape sensing by solving a, likely nonlinear, optimization problem which aims to find an agreement between the sensor measurements and the backbone shapes attainable by the chosen kinematic model.
% We proposed (1) a approach relying on cameras attached to the soft robot's body perceiving the environment combined with \gls{vSLAM} algorithms, and (2) embedded magnets and magnetic sensors.
% We have verified both approaches experimentally with a pneumatically-actuated soft segment. Future work should investigate the reliability and performance of such methods on multi-segment soft robots.
% Furthermore, we realize that current proprioception approaches~\cite{wang2018toward, hegde2023sensing} rarely make use of dynamic model knowledge to filter the state estimates. Therefore, we suggest to further explore and embrace the usage of nonlinear observers~\citet{shao2023model} for improving the state estimates.
In Chapters~\ref{chp:srslam} and \ref{chp:promasens}, we demonstrated that kinematic models (e.g., \gls{PCC}~\citep{webster2010design}) can be employed for shape sensing by solving a nonlinear optimization problem that aligns sensor measurements with the backbone shapes attainable by the chosen kinematic model. We proposed two approaches: one using cameras, the robot perceiving and tracking its environment combined with \gls{vSLAM} algorithms, and another utilizing embedded magnets with magnetic sensors. Both methods were validated experimentally on a pneumatically-actuated soft segment, though future work should assess their reliability and performance on multi-segment robots. Additionally, as current proprioception methods rarely incorporate dynamic model information for filtering state estimates, we advocate exploring nonlinear observers~\citep{shao2023model} to enhance state estimation.

\subsection{Contribution III - Control with Advanced Physics-based Actuation Models for Soft Robots}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} We can develop advanced actuation models for soft robots by deriving the actuation behavior from first principle and can exploit the new model knowledge using existing nonlinear control techniques such as backstepping for control.
%     \item \textbf{Limitations:} Very soft robot specific. As a large variety of actuation methods exist for soft robots, a separate model needs to be developed for every case.
% \end{itemize}
% In Chapters~\ref{chp:hsamodel} \& \ref{chp:backstepping}, we have demonstrated the derivation of physics-based actuation models for soft robots from first principles and have subsequently demonstrated how the newly obtained actuation model knowledge can be exploited for control using existing techniques, for example via mapping into actuation coordinates~\citep{pustina2024input} or backstepping~\citep{khalil2002nonlinear}.
% In the case of planar \gls{HSA} robots, we also have conducted extensive experimental studies verifying both the model and the derived controller.
% Beyond the limitations of the individual models and controllers, we note that the large variety of actuation modalities for soft robots spanning from pneumatic, tendon-driven actuation via dielectric elastomers and metamaterials~\citep{zaidi2021actuation} to shape memory alloys poses a major challenge for the community as each actuation concept needs to be individually modeled and specialized controllers need to be derived~\citep{copaci2020flexible, soleti2024nonlinear, soleti2025model}.
In Chapters~\ref{chp:hsamodel} and \ref{chp:backstepping}, we derived physics-based actuation models for soft robots from first principles and demonstrated how to leverage these models for control—using methods like mapping into actuation coordinates~\citep{pustina2024input} and backstepping~\citep{khalil2002nonlinear}. For planar \gls{HSA} robots, we further validated both the model and controller through extensive experiments. However, the wide range of soft robot actuation modalities—from pneumatic and tendon-driven systems to dielectric elastomers, metamaterials~\citep{zaidi2021actuation}, and shape memory alloys—poses a significant challenge for the community, as each actuation method requires its own tailored modeling approach and specialized controller~\citep{copaci2020flexible, soleti2024nonlinear, soleti2025model}.

\subsection{Contribution IV - Integrating Physical Structure and Stability Guarantees into Learned Models}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} Learn models while incorporating physical priors and stability guarantees by directly using the dynamics of a defined mechanical/physical system and learning the free dynamic parameters and optionally a change of coordinates/encoding.
%     \item \textbf{Limitations:} No real-world experiments, strong assumptions on attractor type (i.e., \gls{GAS})/soft robot kinematic model, no terms to capture time-dependent effects, hybrid or discontinuous dynamics, etc.
% \end{itemize}
% In this thesis, we presented two approaches for integrating physical structure and stability guarantees into learned models for soft robots.
% With physical structure, we specifically refer to a formulation of the dynamics that allow us to define potential and kinetic energy terms.
% Both approaches build on existing dynamic models of physical systems, and instead of capturing the entire dynamics using a \emph{black-box} model (e.g., a neural network), we identify the free parameters of the physics-based dynamic model. This can be optionally combined with a coordinate change/encoding into a latent space to increase expressiveness and reduce the dimensionality of the learned dynamics.
In this thesis, we proposed two methods to integrate physical structure and stability guarantees into learned models for soft robots. By physical structure, we mean a formulation of the dynamics that explicitly defines potential and kinetic energy terms. Rather than modeling the entire dynamics with a black-box approach (e.g., a neural network), both methods leverage existing physics-based dynamic models by identifying their free parameters. This process can optionally include a coordinate transformation or encoding into a latent space to enhance expressiveness and reduce dimensionality.

% The first approach included in Chapter~\ref{chp:pcsregression} proposes a data-driven strategy for the derivation of the \gls{PCS}-a based kinematic model. In particular, our approach is able to make the trade-off between the dimensionality of the configuration and the accuracy of the body shape reconstruction explicit. Subsequently, a dynamic model in Euler-Lagrange form is derived, and its parameters can be identified in closed form.
% The stability of both open-loop and closed-loop systems can subsequently analyzed using Lyapunov arguments~\citep{khalil2002nonlinear}, as done previously for similar physics-based soft robotic models~\citep{della2023model}.
The first method, presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:pcsregression}, introduces a data-driven strategy for deriving a \gls{PCS}-based kinematic model. Our approach explicitly balances the trade-off between configuration dimensionality and backbone shape reconstruction accuracy. An Euler-Lagrange dynamic model is then derived, with its parameters identified in closed form. Stability for both open-loop and closed-loop systems can subsequently be analyzed using Lyapunov arguments~\citep{khalil2002nonlinear}, similar to previous work on physics-based soft robotic models~\citep{della2023model}.

% The second approach presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:con} proposes to learn latent dynamics of physical systems, and specifically of soft robots, using a network of nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators. This strategy provides a mechanical interpretation to the latent space as now each latent variable corresponds to the position of an oscillator. Furthermore, the kinetic and potential energy terms of this mechanical system allow us to prove its open-loop stability, specifically global asymptotic and input-to-state stability, using established Lyapunov arguments. 
The second method, described in Chapter~\ref{chp:con}, focuses on learning the latent dynamics of soft robots through a network of nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators. This strategy provides a clear mechanical interpretation of the latent space, as each latent variable corresponds to the position of an oscillator. Moreover, the kinetic and potential energy terms inherent to this system enable us to prove its open-loop stability—specifically global asymptotic and input-to-state stability—using established Lyapunov techniques.

% Finally, we compare the differences of the two proposed methods. A major benefit of the strain-model-based approach presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:pcsregression} lies in the fully \emph{white-box} nature as the final derived dynamical model is fully physics-based and inspectable. Furthermore, it exhibits a strong inductive bias for the particular dynamics of soft robots, which can be both a benefit and a potential weakness: the inductive bias improves data efficiency, reduces the danger of overfitting, and leads to exceptional extrapolation capabilities. However, when the soft robot exhibits dynamics, such as hysteresis, nonlinear elasticity, deforming cross-sections, or significant interactions with the environment, they could likely not be captured by this \gls{PCS}-based model.
% This is the major advantage of the second approach, where the coordinate transformation/encoding into latent space increases the ability to learn a diverse set of different dynamics, as demonstrated by the simulation results.
% Where this is still not sufficient, the network could be, in the future, easily augmented with additional terms, such as hysteresis or contact models, which we go into more detail on in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion:future_work}.
% This added expressiveness, however, comes at the loss of the direct interpretation of the latent variables as parameters of a kinematic model parametrizing the soft robot's backbone shape.
Finally, we compare the two methods. A major advantage of the strain-model-based approach from Chapter~\ref{chp:pcsregression} is its fully white-box nature, resulting in a fully interpretable, physics-based dynamical model with a strong inductive bias for soft robot dynamics. This bias improves data efficiency, reduces overfitting, and enhances extrapolation, but it may struggle with dynamics such as hysteresis, nonlinear elasticity, deforming cross-sections, or significant environmental interactions. In contrast, the second approach, through its latent space encoding, is better equipped to learn a wider variety of dynamics, as demonstrated in the presented results. Where needed in the future, the network can be easily augmented with additional components (e.g., hysteresis or contact models, discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion:future_work}). The expressiveness added by the encoder sacrifices the direct interpretability of the latent variables as parameters of a kinematic model for the soft robot’s backbone shape.

\subsection{Contribution V - Exploiting Learned Models for Closed-Form Model-Based Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} We can leverage learned models with a physical structure, particularly kinetic and potential energy terms, for closed-form model-based control via energy-shaping.
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Only setpoint regulation - no trajectory tracking, no real-world experiments, not clear how/if it would work in the underactuated setting.
\end{itemize}
This thesis has found that we can leverage existing PID+energy shaping controllers~\citep{kelly1995tuning, kelly1996class, kelly1998global, sciavicco2012modelling, della2023model} for closed-form control with learned models that exhibit a physical structure as introduced in Contribution~\ref{contrib:learned_models}.
Specifically, the regulation controller that we studied in this thesis consists of an integral-saturated PID (P-satI-D)~\citep{pustina2022p} as the feedback term and a potential shaping feedforward term.


\subsection{Beyond Low-Level Control: Generating Compliant Motion Behaviors for Soft Robots}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Answer to RQ:} We found it essential that not only the low-level controller but also the high-level motion policy is compliant. However, an approach exists in the realm of rigid robotics, which we can re-purpose for soft robots with (minor) modifications.
%     \item \textbf{Limitations:} High-level motion planning/policies for soft robots are still underexplored. Strategies developed for rigid manipulators often implicitly aim to avoid (unnecessary) contact and only interact with the environment through the end-effector/gripper. Instead, soft robots should embrace contact as this allows them to exploit their embodied intelligence. Future motion planners/policies for soft robots should embrace contact throughout the entire body.
% \end{itemize}
% In this thesis, we proposed two approaches to instilling compliant motion behavior in soft robots and guiding low-level controllers by passing setpoints: In Chapter~\ref{chp:braincontrol}, we present a \gls{BMI} approach for allowing users to guide soft robots via motor imagery. Specifically, we measure brain signals with a wearable \gls{EEG} device and subsequently propose an effective protocol for moving the soft robot's end-effector based on binary classification of the motor imagination.
In this thesis, we introduced two methods for achieving compliant motion in soft robots that allow guidance of low-level controllers with setpoints. In Chapter~\ref{chp:braincontrol}, we developed a \glsextrafull{BMI} that enables users to control soft robots through motor imagery. By binary classifying brain signals recorded with a wearable \gls{EEG} device, this approach effectively and safely directs the robot’s end-effector.

% The second approach included in Chapter~\ref{chp:osmp} devised a \gls{SMP}-based approach for parametrizing a periodic motion policy with a dynamical system while guaranteeing orbital stability. 
% This allows for learning complex periodic motion from demonstration without giving up stability guarantees and insight into the motion behavior.
% The velocity commanded by the \gls{SMP}, for example, defined in task or configuration space, can then serve as a reference for low-level controllers.
% We demonstrated how such an approach leads to more compliant and natural motions under perturbations by the environment compared to traditional approaches, such as a time-parametrized trajectory tracking controller.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:osmp}, we presented a \gls{SMP}-based method to parameterize periodic motion policies using a dynamical system that guarantees orbital stability. This technique allows for the learning of complex periodic motions from demonstrations without sacrificing stability or insight into the motion behavior, with the generated velocity commands—whether defined in task or configuration space—serving as references for low-level controllers. Our results show that this method produces more compliant and natural motions under environmental perturbations compared to traditional time-parametrized trajectory tracking.

% Both approaches have been experimentally verified on \gls{HSA} and helicoid~\citep{guan2023trimmed} soft robots, respectively.
% Furthermore, both approaches how we can adapt approaches originally developed for rigid robots/manipulators for soft robots under minor modifications.
% Sill, we find, while there has been some initial research~\citep{goldman2014compliant, greer2020robust, selvaggio2020obstacle, rao2024towards, rao2024tendon}, high-level motion planning/policies for soft robots are still underexplored.
% In particular, approaches developed for rigid manipulators inherently aim to avoid contact with the environment outside of planned interactions of the end-effector/gripper when its unavoidable, for example, for picking up objects.
% Instead, we argue that soft robots should embrace contact with the environment throughout its entire body to allow full exploitation of its physical intelligence.
% This will require a shift in mindset and in the future adapted motion planning approaches and motion policies that optimally select and exploit such contacts with the environment.
Both approaches were experimentally validated on \gls{HSA} and helicoid soft robots~\citep{guan2023trimmed}, respectively, illustrating that techniques originally developed for rigid manipulators can be adapted with minimal modifications for soft robots. However, despite some initial research~\citep{goldman2014compliant, greer2020robust, selvaggio2020obstacle, rao2024towards, rao2024tendon}, high-level motion planning and policy design tailored to soft robots remain underexplored. Unlike rigid manipulators that avoid unintended environmental contacts, soft robots should capitalize on contact along their entire bodies to fully leverage their embodied intelligence. This shift calls for new motion planning strategies that optimally exploit these interactions.
