\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{chp:conclusion}

\textit{
    % This concluding chapter of this dissertation reviews and analyzes the key findings. First, we review the various contributions of this thesis, analyze their potential impact on the field, and acknowledge any limitations that we observe.
    % Subsequently, we introduce direction for future work. We do this by first giving some general recommendations for the field of soft robotics, and subsequently detailing more concretely several directions of future work, ranging from further community wide work on a safety metric to integrating \glspl{SMP} with \gls{VLA} models with the goal of high-performance and generalist motion control of (soft) robots while preserving robustness, compliance, and decision interpretability.
    This final chapter summarizes and examines the key findings of this dissertation. First, we revisit the various contributions of this thesis, evaluate their potential impact on the field, and acknowledge observed limitations. Next, we outline directions for future work. We begin with general recommendations for the field of soft robotics and then detail several specific avenues for future research, ranging from community-wide efforts to establish a safety metric to integrating \glspl{SMP} with \gls{VLA} models, which aims to achieve high-performance, generalist motion control of (soft) robots while preserving robustness, compliance, and decision interpretability.
