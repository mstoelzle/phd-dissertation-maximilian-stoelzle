\section{Model-Based Control}\label{sec:background:model_based_control}
For simplicity, we refer in the following to the fully actuated case and specifically the case of an identified actuation matrix $A = \mathbb{I}_n$.
For an extended discussion on the control in the underactuated setting (i.e., $m < n$), we refer the interested reader to \citet{pustina2025analysis}.
