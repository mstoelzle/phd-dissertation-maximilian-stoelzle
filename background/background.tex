\chapter{Background on Modeling and Control of Soft Robots}\label{chp:background}

% In this Chapter, we provide background on existing approaches for modeling, both kinematically and dynamically, soft robots and subsequently exploiting them within closed-form model-based controllers.
\dropcap{I}n this chapter, we review existing approaches for both kinematic and dynamic modeling of soft robots and discuss how these models are subsequently exploited in closed-form model-based controllers.
