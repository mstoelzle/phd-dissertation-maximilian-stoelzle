\chapter{Background on Modeling and Control of Soft Robots}\label{chp:background}

% In this Chapter, we provide background on existing approaches for modeling, both kinematically and dynamically, soft robots and subsequently exploiting them within closed-form model-based controllers.
\dropcap{I}n this chapter, we review existing approaches for both kinematic and dynamic modeling of soft robots and discuss how these models can subsequently be exploited in closed-form model-based controllers.
% We stress that all of kinematic and dynamic modeling~\citep{armanini2023soft} of soft robots and model-based control of soft robots~\citep{della2023model} are very much active areas of research and the content presented in this chapter was predominantly only proposed in recent years~\citep{yasa2023overview}.
We emphasize that kinematic and dynamic modeling~\citep{armanini2023soft} of soft robots, as well as model-based control~\citep{della2023model}, remain highly active areas of research, and that much of the content presented in this chapter has only been proposed in recent years~\citep{yasa2023overview}.
