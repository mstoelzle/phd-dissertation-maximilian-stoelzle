\chapter{Model-based Control of Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA) Robots}
\label{chp:hsacontrol}

\begin{abstract}
    Parallel robots based on Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSAs) can implement complex motions using standard electric motors while maintaining the complete softness of the structure, thanks to specifically designed architected metamaterials.
    However, their control is especially challenging due to varying and coupled stiffness, shearing, non-affine terms in the actuation model, and underactuation. In this chapter, we present two model-based control strategies for planar HSA robots enabling regulation in task space. 
    In the first strategy, we perform steady-state planning to identify a statically admittable robot shape with matching actuation, show that the configuration-space dynamics admit a collocated form, and design a P-satI-D feedback controller with compensation for elastic and gravitational forces in configuration space. 
    Secondly, we derive a task-space impedance controller that allows us to unite the soft robot's embodied intelligence with computational intelligence to guarantee compliance and interaction safety.
    We experimentally verify both proposed control strategies in closed loop.
