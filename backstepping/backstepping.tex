\chapter{Backstepping Control of Piston-Driven Pneumatically-Actuated Soft Robots}
\label{chp:backstepping}

\begin{abstract}
    Actuators' dynamics have been so far mostly neglected when devising feedback controllers for continuum soft robots since the problem under the direct actuation hypothesis is already quite hard to solve. Directly considering actuation would have made the challenge too complex. However, these effects are, in practice, far from being negligible. The present chapter focuses on model-based control of piston-driven pneumatically-actuated soft robots. We propose a model of the relationship between the robot's state, the acting fluidic pressure, and the piston dynamics, which is agnostic to the chosen model for the soft system dynamics. 
    We show that backstepping is applicable even if the feedback coupling of the outer on the inner subsystem is not linear.
    Thus, we introduce a general model-based control strategy based on backstepping for soft robots actuated by fluidic drive. As an example, we derive a specialized version for a robot with piecewise constant curvature.
