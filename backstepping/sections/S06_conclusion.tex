\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:backstepping:conclusion}
%
This chapter proposed a model for soft robots actuated using pneumatic fluidic drive cylinders and introduced a model-based controller to take actuators' dynamics into account. The stability of this backstepping-based control strategy was proven using a Lyapunov argument.  As an example of application, model and control strategy have been specialized for the planar \gls{PCC}-case. We also proposed a coupling-aware extension of the standard hierarchical PID strategy as a middle-ground solution. %Our simulations show the feasibility and convergence properties of the nonlinear backstepping controller for the set-point control. % of a \gls{PCC}-modeled soft robotic arm consisting of three segments. 
% While the backstepping controller is agnostic to any changes in the actuation system parameters, the PID controller would require an extensive re-tuning of its gains.
%
Future work will focus on applying this strategy to more sophisticated models and controllers and on experimental validation in a lab environment. %Also, we will consider different kind of actuation dynamics.
