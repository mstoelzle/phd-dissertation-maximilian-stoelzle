\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:backstepping:conclusion}
%
This chapter proposed a model for soft robots actuated using pneumatic fluidic drive cylinders and introduced a model-based controller to take actuators' dynamics into account. The stability of this backstepping-based control strategy was proven using a Lyapunov argument.  As an example of application, model and control strategy have been specialized for the planar \gls{PCC}-case. We also proposed a coupling-aware extension of the standard hierarchical PID strategy as a middle-ground solution.

% Future work will focus on applying this strategy to more sophisticated models and controllers and on experimental validation in a lab environment. 
% Specifically, the model (in particular the the fluidic volume model) and controller should be augmented to allow for control in 3D instead of only in planar settings.
% Also, it would be interesting to investigate if a similar backstepping-based control approach could be applied to the other type of pneumatic actuation - pressure regulation via valve systems.
Future work will focus on extending this strategy to more sophisticated models and controllers while validating it experimentally in a lab environment. In particular, the model—especially the fluidic volume model—and the controller should be enhanced and augmented to enable 3D control rather than being limited to planar settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore whether a similar backstepping-based control approach could be applied to alternative pneumatic actuation methods~\citep{franco2024model}, such as pressure regulation via valve systems.
