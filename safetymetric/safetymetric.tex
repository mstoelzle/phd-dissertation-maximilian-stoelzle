\chapter{Towards Quantifying the Safety of Soft Robots}
\label{chp:safetymetric}

\begin{foreword}
    % Traditionally, most effort in the robotics community has been on achieving safety through computational intelligence, i.e., by constraining motions to remain in a safe set of states, avoid obstacles, and compliant controllers such as impedance control. One of the most interesting and promising aspects of soft robots, on the other hand, is that their embodied intelligence contributes passive compliance to the system. However, in existing literature, the effect on the overall safety of the entire soft robotic system has not been thoroughly investigated or quantified. This lack of safety metric for soft robotics prevents us from considering it during the design process leading to either to badly performing and/or unsafe designs. This chapter proposes a safety metric for soft robots that captures both the embodied intelligence (i.e., the passive behavior) and the computational intelligence (i.e., the controller) of the system, allowing us, for the first time, to investigate quantitatively the effect on each on the overall safety and performance.
    Traditionally, efforts in the robotics community have focused on achieving safety through computational intelligence. This includes constraining motions to remain within safe state sets, avoiding obstacles, and employing compliant controllers such as impedance control. In contrast, one of the most intriguing and promising features of soft robots is their embodied intelligence, which provides passive compliance to the system. Despite this promise, existing literature has yet to thoroughly investigate or quantify the impact of embodied intelligence on the overall safety of soft robotic systems. The absence of a dedicated safety metric for soft robotics hampers the design process, often leading to underperforming or unsafe designs. This chapter introduces a safety metric for soft robots that captures both the embodied intelligence (i.e., the passive behavior) and computational intelligence (e.g., controller) of the system. For the first time, this allows for a quantitative evaluation of their combined effects on system safety and performance.

    % As we work towards integrating robots into human-centric environments, we need to ensure safety while not overly restricting the robot design and/or behavior design. The quest for making robots safer has existed for a long time, with efforts mostly focused on making their control safer and more compliant. Soft robots offer a fundamentally different take on this topic by achieving safety through passive compliance of the entire body. While there has been tremendous research progress in the domain of soft robotics in recent years, ranging from novel actuators to effective model-based control approaches, one of the fundamental promises, safety, has rarely been studied in a principled fashion. In particular, we notice the lack of a quantitative metric to assess how \emph{safe} a soft robot really is. Adding on, we notice that most works take too much of a simplified approach to this topic, equaling safety to material softness. Instead, in reality, the safety of the closed-loop system is influenced by many aspects such as topology, controller, etc, leading to suboptimal soft robot designs that are, for example, too soft to carry practical payloads. Instead, a quantitative safety metric would allow designers to analyze and exploit the safety-vs-performance tradeoff and identify more performant designs while still meeting the necessary safety requirements. In this chapter, we devise requirements a safety metric for soft robots would need to meet. Subsequently, we propose a safety metric that measures the injury severity based on the maximum contact pressure experienced during a collision, as it is already the standard for collaborative robots. Finally, we analyze the safety of continuum soft robots modeled according to the \gls{PCS} parametrization and devise a few simple recommendations for safe soft robot design.

    % Integrating robots into human-centric environments requires ensuring safety without overly restricting the robot's behavior. While soft robotics inherently enhances safety by adding passive body compliance, its core promise—safety—has been largely understudied in a principled manner. Most research equates safety to material softness, overlooking the complex interplay of factors like topology and control systems, which often leads to suboptimal designs that may be too soft to carry practical payloads. A quantitative safety metric could address this issue, enabling designers to balance the trade-off between safety and performance, thus achieving more effective designs while meeting safety requirements. In this chapter, we identify the requirements for a meaningful safety metric for soft robots and propose one based on maximum contact pressure during collisions, consistent with standards for collaborative robots. Using this metric, we analyze the safety of continuum soft robots modeled with the \gls{PCS} parametrization. Finally, we provide recommendations for designing safer soft robots that optimize both performance and safety.

    As we work toward integrating robots into human-centric environments, it is crucial to ensure safety without overly constraining robot design or behavior. Efforts to enhance robot safety have a long history, primarily focusing on improving control systems to make them safer and more compliant. Soft robots offer a fundamentally different approach to this challenge by achieving safety through the passive compliance of their entire structure. Despite significant advancements in soft robotics over recent years—spanning novel actuators to sophisticated model-based control methods—one of the field’s core promises, safety, has rarely been systematically studied. Notably, there is a lack of a quantitative metric to evaluate how safe a soft robot truly is.
    Moreover, most existing studies oversimplify the concept of safety, equating it to material softness. In reality, the safety of a closed-loop system depends on multiple factors, such as topology and control strategies. This narrow focus often results in suboptimal soft robot designs, such as robots that are too soft to handle practical payloads effectively. A quantitative safety metric would enable designers to evaluate and balance the tradeoff between safety and performance, leading to more optimal designs that meet safety requirements without sacrificing functionality.
    In this chapter, we outline the essential criteria for a safety metric tailored to soft robots. We then propose a metric that assesses injury severity based on the maximum contact pressure during a collision, aligning with established standards for collaborative robots. Finally, we characterize the proposed safety metric on continuum soft robots modeled using the \gls{PCS} parametrization. % and provide practical recommendations for designing safe soft robots.

% \section{Design of Safe Soft Robots}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Based on the insights gained in Section~\ref{sec:safety_metric}, give \emph{simple} insights how safe designs can be achieved.
%     \item Stiffness of the soft robot design (i.e., not just of the material) should be reduced, particularly close to the base/proximal end.
%     \item Reflected mass (e.g., material density \& volume) should be reduced, in particular close to the tip/distal end.
%     \item Guidelines for establishing safe controllers.
%     \item Specifically, explain how the combination of robot stiffness and the proportional control gains impacts the design hazardousness.
%     \item However, we stress that \emph{simple} guidelines that guarantee a specific safety level cannot be (easily) expressed. Therefore, we require a co-design methodology that takes into account the safety metric.
