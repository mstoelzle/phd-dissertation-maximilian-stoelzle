\chapter{Towards Quantifying the Safety of Soft Robots}
\label{chp:safetymetric}

\begin{foreword}
    % Traditionally, most effort in the robotics community has been on achieving safety through computational intelligence, i.e., by constraining motions to remain in a safe set of states, avoid obstacles, and compliant controllers such as impedance control. One of the most interesting and promising aspects of soft robots, on the other hand, is that their embodied intelligence contributes passive compliance to the system. However, in existing literature, the effect on the overall safety of the entire soft robotic system has not been thoroughly investigated or quantified. This lack of safety metric for soft robotics prevents us from considering it during the design process leading to either to badly performing and/or unsafe designs. This chapter proposes a safety metric for soft robots that captures both the embodied intelligence (i.e., the passive behavior) and the computational intelligence (i.e., the controller) of the system, allowing us, for the first time, to investigate quantitatively the effect on each on the overall safety and performance.
    % Traditionally, efforts in the robotics community have focused on achieving safety through computational intelligence. This includes constraining motions to remain within safe state sets, avoiding obstacles, and employing compliant controllers such as impedance control. In contrast, one of the most intriguing and promising features of soft robots is their embodied intelligence, which provides passive compliance to the system. Despite this promise, existing literature has yet to thoroughly investigate or quantify the impact of embodied intelligence on the overall safety of soft robotic systems. The absence of a dedicated safety metric for soft robotics hampers the design process, often leading to underperforming or unsafe designs. This chapter introduces a safety metric for soft robots that captures both the embodied intelligence (i.e., the open-loop behavior) and computational intelligence (e.g., controller) of the system. For the first time, this allows for a quantitative evaluation of their combined effects on system safety and performance.

    % Traditionally, efforts in the robotics community have focused on achieving safety through computational intelligence. This includes constraining motions to remain within safe state sets, avoiding obstacles, and employing compliant controllers such as impedance control. In contrast, one of the most intriguing and promising features of soft robots is their intrinsic compliance via material softness. 
    % However, the achieved safety has yet to be quantified, which prevents us from actually determining if soft robots are safe and by how much soft robots are safer than (collaborative) robots - a crucial point in motivating soft robotics research and development.
    % Furthermore, often times, the community will focus on the correlation between material softness and safety, ignoring other important factors such as mass density, operating conditions, and control policy.
    % This lack of understanding which factors signficantly influence the safety of soft robots often leads to designs that are overly soft resulting in degraded performance at practical tasks (e.g., limited payload ability, imprecise and oscillatory motion).
    % In particular, as control is the focus of this thesis, it is crucial to understand which characteristics of controllers influence the safety of the closed-loop system and how we need to design controllers to maximize performance while preserving safety, which is another important goal of this thesis.
    % Therefore, this chapter focuses on the derivation of a quantitative safety metric for soft robots.

This lack of understanding about the factors that significantly influence soft robot safety often leads to overly soft designs that suffer from degraded performance in practical tasks (e.g., limited payload capacity, imprecise or oscillatory motion). Since control is a central focus of this thesis, it is vital to identify which controller characteristics affect the safety of the closed-loop system, an often overseen aspect in the soft robotics domain, and how to design controllers that maximize performance while preserving safety. Therefore, this chapter focuses on deriving a quantitative safety metric for soft robots.

    % Original version
    % As we work towards integrating robots into human-centric environments, we need to ensure safety while not overly restricting the robot design and/or behavior design. The quest for making robots safer has existed for a long time, with efforts mostly focused on making their control safer and more compliant. Soft robots offer a fundamentally different take on this topic by achieving safety through passive compliance of the entire body. While there has been tremendous research progress in the domain of soft robotics in recent years, ranging from novel actuators to effective model-based control approaches, one of the fundamental promises, safety, has rarely been studied in a principled fashion. In particular, we notice the lack of a quantitative metric to assess how \emph{safe} a soft robot really is. Adding on, we notice that most works take too much of a simplified approach to this topic, equaling safety to material softness. Instead, in reality, the safety of the closed-loop system is influenced by many aspects such as topology, controller, etc, leading to suboptimal soft robot designs that are, for example, too soft to carry practical payloads. Instead, a quantitative safety metric would allow designers to analyze and exploit the safety-vs-performance tradeoff and identify more performant designs while still meeting the necessary safety requirements. In this chapter, we devise requirements a safety metric for soft robots would need to meet. Subsequently, we propose a safety metric that measures the injury severity based on the maximum contact pressure experienced during a collision, as it is already the standard for collaborative robots. Finally, we analyze the safety of continuum soft robots modeled according to the \gls{PCS} parametrization and devise a few simple recommendations for safe soft robot design.

    % Integrating robots into human-centric environments requires ensuring safety without overly restricting the robot's behavior. While soft robotics inherently enhances safety by adding passive body compliance, its core promise—safety—has been largely understudied in a principled manner. Most research equates safety to material softness, overlooking the complex interplay of factors like topology and control systems, which often leads to suboptimal designs that may be too soft to carry practical payloads. A quantitative safety metric could address this issue, enabling designers to balance the trade-off between safety and performance, thus achieving more effective designs while meeting safety requirements. In this chapter, we identify the requirements for a meaningful safety metric for soft robots and propose one based on maximum contact pressure during collisions, consistent with standards for collaborative robots. Using this metric, we analyze the safety of continuum soft robots modeled with the \gls{PCS} parametrization. Finally, we provide recommendations for designing safer soft robots that optimize both performance and safety.

    As we work toward integrating robots into human-centric environments, it is crucial to ensure safety without overly constraining robot design or behavior. Efforts to enhance robot safety have a long history, primarily focusing on improving control systems to make them safer and more compliant. Soft robots offer a fundamentally different approach to this challenge by achieving safety through the passive compliance of their entire structure. Despite significant advancements in soft robotics over recent years—spanning novel actuators to sophisticated model-based control methods—one of the field’s core promises, safety, has rarely been systematically studied. Notably, there is a lack of a quantitative metric to evaluate how safe a soft robot truly is.
    Moreover, most existing studies oversimplify the concept of safety, equating it to material softness. In reality, the safety of a closed-loop system depends on multiple factors, such as topology and control strategies. This narrow focus often results in suboptimal soft robot designs, such as robots that are too soft to handle practical payloads effectively. A quantitative safety metric would enable designers to evaluate and balance the tradeoff between safety and performance, leading to more optimal designs that meet safety requirements without sacrificing functionality.
    In this chapter, we outline the essential criteria for a safety metric tailored to soft robots. We then propose a metric that assesses injury severity based on the maximum contact pressure during a collision, aligning with established standards for collaborative robots. Finally, we characterize the proposed safety metric on continuum soft robots modeled using the \gls{PCS} parametrization. % and provide practical recommendations for designing safe soft robots.

% \section{Design of Safe Soft Robots}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Based on the insights gained in Section~\ref{sec:safety_metric}, give \emph{simple} insights how safe designs can be achieved.
%     \item Stiffness of the soft robot design (i.e., not just of the material) should be reduced, particularly close to the base/proximal end.
%     \item Reflected mass (e.g., material density \& volume) should be reduced, in particular close to the tip/distal end.
%     \item Guidelines for establishing safe controllers.
%     \item Specifically, explain how the combination of robot stiffness and the proportional control gains impacts the design hazardousness.
%     \item However, we stress that \emph{simple} guidelines that guarantee a specific safety level cannot be (easily) expressed. Therefore, we require a co-design methodology that takes into account the safety metric.

\section*{Afterword}
% This chapter devised for the first time a quantitative safety metric for soft robots and outlines potential applications, such as safety-aware design and control, which could benefit from such a safety metric.
% In particular, it shows a way towards how the safety of soft robots could be in the future determined, ensured, and certified.
% Moreover, the characterization of the safety metric also revealed which factors, such as material softness, mass density, and operating conditions significantly influence the safety of soft robots.
% One such important factor that so far has often been neglected in the soft robots community is the control policy. Our analysis confirmed that, analog to what is already known in the realm of collaborative robots, proportional feedback gains generally indeed decrease the safety of soft robots.
% Therefore, this chapter informs us that, as one of the goals of this thesis is to ensure safety, it is crucial to design control approaches in a compliant fashion (e.g., removing integral terms, reducing feedback gains) which motivates (a) the adoption of compliant controllers for soft robots, such as the impedance controller presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:hsacontrol}, and (b) to devise effective feedforward terms based on accurate modeling of the system dynamics - a topic that we explore in a first-principle fashion in Chapters~\ref{chp:hsamodel}, \ref{chp:hsacontrol}, \& \ref{chp:backstepping}, and in a learning based fashion in Chapters~\ref{chp:pcsregression}-\ref{chp:con}.
In this chapter, we introduced a quantitative safety metric for continuum soft robots and discussed potential applications—such as safety-aware design and control—that could benefit from it. Specifically, it outlines a pathway for determining, ensuring, and certifying soft robot safety in the future. Additionally, characterizing the metric revealed that factors like material softness, mass density, and operating conditions significantly affect soft robot safety. Notably, the control policy—often overlooked in the soft robotics community—plays a critical role; our analysis confirms that, similar to findings in collaborative robotics, higher proportional feedback gains tend to reduce safety. Consequently, since ensuring safety is a important goal of this thesis, it is essential to design control strategies that maintain compliance (for instance, by eliminating integral terms and reducing feedback gains). This insight motivates both (a) the adoption of compliant controllers for soft robots, such as the impedance controller presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:hsacontrol}, and (b) the development of effective feedforward terms based on accurate system dynamics modeling—a topic we explore from first principles in Chapters~\ref{chp:hsamodel}, \ref{chp:hsacontrol}, and \ref{chp:backstepping}, as well as through learning-based approaches in Chapters~\ref{chp:pcsregression}–\ref{chp:con}.
