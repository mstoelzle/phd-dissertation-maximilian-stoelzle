\chapter{Towards Ensuring Robotic Safety with Embodied and Computational Intelligence}
\label{chp:safetymetric}

\begin{abstract}
    Soft robots offer the promise of intrinsic safety and adaptability, enabling seamless interactions with humans and delicate environments.
    Yet, their complex design requirements across multiple components and disciplines have limited their practical deployment.
    In this context, a critical challenge lies in the largely unexplored trade-off between task-specific performance and safety, compounded by the absence of a standardized, quantitative safety metric.
    In this work, we introduce a novel safety metric and integrate it into a holistic co-design methodology.
    The proposed framework allows for the simultaneous optimization of safety and performance, accounting for design factors such as materials, geometry, modeling, actuation, and control.
    By considering safety directly at the design stage, we pave the way for soft robots that are not only tailored to specific applications but also exhibit suitable compliance in the real world.
    We believe that this new co-design framework for soft robots has the potential to redefine human-robot interaction, promoting greater acceptance and trust in (soft) robotic systems.
