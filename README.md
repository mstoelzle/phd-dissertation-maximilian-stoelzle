## üîç Abstract

Continuum soft robots, by virtue of passive compliance, promise safer interaction in close proximity to humans than rigid counterparts, but precision remains limited by modeling and control challenges. This thesis addresses the safety‚Äìprecision trade‚Äëoff by coupling physics‚Äëstructured learned models with interpretable, closed‚Äëform controllers that admit Lyapunov guarantees and run efficiently at high rates. We first introduce a quantitative safety metric for continuum soft robots, assessing both body compliance and the control policy. We then advance proprioception by fusing kinematic priors with commercial vision and magnetic sensors. On the actuation side, we derive kinematic and dynamic models for auxetic metamaterial ("HSA") and piston‚Äëdriven pneumatic robots and design provably stable regulators‚Äîintegral‚Äësaturated PID with potential shaping and Cartesian impedance (HSA) and a backstepping scheme (pneumatics)‚Äîrevealing crucial insights into physical priors and model structures that enable efficient, stable control. However, such first‚Äëprinciples models derived by domain experts often lack the expressiveness needed to capture the complex deformation behavior of soft robots. In the second part of the thesis, we therefore leverage advanced machine‚Äëlearning methods, embedding kinetic and potential‚Äëenergy structure into dynamics identification: (i) extracting low‚Äëdimensional strain models from backbone‚Äëshape evolution, and (ii) learning latent‚Äëspace dynamics as coupled oscillator networks with proven global asymptotic and input‚Äëto‚Äëstate stability, enabling closed‚Äëform energy‚Äëshaping control. Beyond low‚Äëlevel control, we demonstrate compliant behaviors via motor‚Äëimagery EEG guidance combined with operational‚Äëspace impedance and a orbitally stable  dynamical system that learns periodic motions from demonstration. The resulting models, sensing pipelines, and controllers are validated in simulation and on hardware, with open‚Äësource code and data, charting a path toward soft robots that are simultaneously safe and precise in human‚Äëcentric settings.

  <em><strong>Core Contribution of this Thesis.</strong> Learned dynamical models endowed with physical structure (kinetic + potential energies) enable closed-form energy-shaping + P-satI-D control: a potential-shaping feedforward for setpoint regulation plus an integral-saturated PID feedback term for disturbance rejection and robustness, while retaining interpretability for Lyapunov stability analysis.</em>

## üèóÔ∏è Key Contributions (Detailed Summary)

Core Contribution:
Safe and precise soft robot control via closed-form energy-shaping controllers that exploit physically structured learned models (kinetic + potential energy terms) to achieve interpretable, stable, and computationally efficient regulation.

1. Quantitative Safety Metric for Soft Robots:
  First metric (SRISC / SRDHC variants) capturing the safety of soft robots by accounting for continuum deformability, elasticity, and contact along the body; informs safe morphology and control design.
2. Kinematics-Guided Shape Sensing:
  Two approaches: (a) vision + vSLAM + projection onto kinematic model to curb drift; (b) magnetic proprioception combining kinematic priors with a learned sensor model solved via optimization.
3. Advanced Actuation Modeling & Control:
  Physics-based kinematic, dynamic, and actuation models for auxetic HSA robots (incl. SPCS parameterization, planar model, inverse kinematics, Euler‚ÄìLagrange dynamics) and impedance + P-satI-D + potential shaping controllers; coupled piston‚Äìcontinuum pneumatic model with backstepping controller integrating actuator dynamics.
4. Physically Structured Learned Models:
  (a) Data-driven identification of PCS strain + dynamics (automatic segmentation, basis-function Euler‚ÄìLagrange representation, closed-form parameter identification, DOF pruning); (b) Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) latent dynamics for high-dimensional observations with mechanical interpretation, Lyapunov-proved GAS / ISS, and fast rollout approximation.
5. Closed-Form Model-Based Control with Learned Models:
  Integral-saturated PID (P-satI-D) feedback + potential compensation at target state; reshapes potential energy for setpoint regulation while retaining robustness to model mismatch; validated on physics-based HSA model, learned strain model, and latent CON dynamics.
6. High-Level Compliant Motion Behaviors:
  (a) Brain‚Äìmachine interface (wearable 3-channel EEG) guiding planar HSA impedance controller via dual binary classifiers; (b) Periodic motion learning using bijective encoder + Hopf bifurcation latent dynamics (orbitally stable motion policy) validated across several robotic platforms.
7. Experimental Validation & Open Science:
  Extensive simulation + hardware experiments across multiple soft robot embodiments; release of code and datasets (see Data DOI) to foster reproducibility.
