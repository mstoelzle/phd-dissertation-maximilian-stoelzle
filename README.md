## üîç Abstract

This thesis tackles the long-standing safety‚Äìprecision trade-off in continuum soft robots by coupling physically structured learned models with interpretable, closed-form, stability-guaranteed controllers that run at high rates without MPC. After motivating limits of first-principles models and direct policy learning, the work advances four technical fronts: (i) a quantitative safety metric for soft-robot interaction; (ii) shape sensing that fuses kinematic priors with commercial vision and magnetic sensors via nonlinear optimization, SLAM, and a learned measurement model; (iii) actuation modeling for auxetic-metamaterial (‚ÄúHSA‚Äù) and piston-driven pneumatic robots, yielding provably stable controllers‚Äîan integral-saturated PID with potential shaping and Cartesian impedance for planar HSA systems, and a backstepping design for pneumatic actuation‚Äîand highlighting hysteresis effects that motivate learning; and (iv) learning methods that embed kinetic and potential energy structure into dynamics identification, including (a) extraction of low-dimensional strain models from backbone-shape evolution and (b) latent-space dynamics realized as coupled harmonic oscillator networks, enabling Lyapunov analysis and energy-shaping control. Beyond low-level control, the thesis demonstrates compliant behaviors via motor-imagery EEG guidance combined with operational-space impedance control, and a time-free, orbitally stable latent dynamical system for learning periodic motions from demonstration. The proposed models, sensing pipelines, and controllers are validated in simulation and on hardware, with code and data released, charting a path to soft robots that are both safe and precise in human-centric settings.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Contributions (Detailed Summary)

Core Contribution:
Safe and precise soft robot control via closed-form energy-shaping controllers that exploit physically structured learned models (kinetic + potential energy terms) to achieve interpretable, stable, and computationally efficient regulation.

1. Quantitative Safety Metric for Soft Robots:
  First metric (SRISC / SRDHC variants) capturing the safety of soft robots by accounting for continuum deformability, elasticity, and contact along the body; informs safe morphology and control design.
2. Kinematics-Guided Shape Sensing:
  Two approaches: (a) vision + vSLAM + projection onto kinematic model to curb drift; (b) magnetic proprioception combining a kinematic prior with a learned sensor model solved via optimization.
3. Advanced Actuation Modeling & Control:
  Physics-based kinematic, dynamic, and actuation models for auxetic HSA robots (incl. SPCS parameterization, planar model, inverse kinematics, Euler‚ÄìLagrange dynamics) and impedance + P-satI-D + potential shaping controllers; coupled piston‚Äìcontinuum pneumatic model with backstepping controller integrating actuator dynamics.
4. Physically Structured Learned Models:
  (a) Data-driven identification of PCS strain + dynamics (automatic segmentation, basis-function Euler‚ÄìLagrange representation, closed-form parameter identification, DOF pruning); (b) Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) latent dynamics for high-dimensional observations with mechanical interpretation, Lyapunov-proved GAS / ISS, and fast rollout approximation.
5. Closed-Form Model-Based Control with Learned Models:
  Integral-saturated PID (P-satI-D) feedback + potential compensation at target state; reshapes potential energy for setpoint regulation while retaining robustness to model mismatch; validated on physics-based HSA model, learned strain model, and latent CON dynamics.
6. High-Level Compliant Motion Behaviors:
  (a) Brain‚Äìmachine interface (wearable 3-channel EEG) guiding planar HSA impedance controller via dual binary classifiers; (b) Time-free periodic motion learning using bijective encoder + Hopf bifurcation latent dynamics (stable motion policy) validated across multiple platforms.
7. Experimental Validation & Open Science:
  Extensive simulation + hardware experiments across multiple soft robot embodiments; release of code and datasets (see Data DOI) to foster reproducibility.
